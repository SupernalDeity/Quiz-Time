## Description
04-JavaScript

 Using almost exclusivley Javascript, I created a quiz that would test the users knowledge and give a score based on performance at the end. The quiz will only progress forward if the correct answer is selected, otherwise a time penalty is incurred on wrong answers. If time runs out then the quiz is terminated and considered game over. Groundword for a highscore feature is also included.
